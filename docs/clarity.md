# CLARITY — Source of Truth

## Clinical Localization and Reasoning Integrity Testing

> **CLARITY** is a deterministic, GPU-accelerated evaluation instrument for measuring the robustness and evidence stability of multimodal clinical AI systems under structured perturbation sweeps.

---

## Project Overview

- **Repository**: [m-cahill/clarity](https://github.com/m-cahill/clarity)
- **License**: Apache-2.0
- **Competition**: MedGemma Impact Challenge (Kaggle)
- **Deadline**: February 24, 2026

---

## Architecture

CLARITY is layered:

```
RediAI-v3 Governance
        ↓
R2L (Deterministic Micro-Lab Engine)
        ↓
CLARITY (Robustness & Integrity Instrument)
        ↓
Model Adapter (GPU-aware)
        ↓
RTX 5090
```

CLARITY operates as a **pure consumer** of R2L — it never modifies R2L execution semantics.

## Deploy/CI Notes

- **Netlify**: Use Deploy Previews for PR visibility (frontend)
- **Render**: Use Deploy Hooks for backend deploy triggers
- **Workflow security**: Prefer pinning actions to SHAs (document exceptions)

## Current Milestone: M00

**Objective**: Establish a full-stack CLARITY skeleton with backend, frontend, CI, and verified E2E path.

**Success Criteria**: Frontend request successfully reaches backend `/health` in CI and passes E2E tests.

**Branch**: `m00-bootstrap`
