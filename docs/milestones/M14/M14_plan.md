# M14 Milestone Plan

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started  
**Baseline:** `v0.0.14-m13` (Score: 5.0)  
**Competition Deadline:** February 24, 2026

---

## Potential Objectives (To Be Determined)

Options for M14:

1. **Rich Mode Evidence Ingestion** — Enable `generate_rich()` path for logits/attention ingestion
2. **Multi-Axis Robustness Expansion** — Higher-resolution sweeps across multiple perturbation axes
3. **Kaggle Packaging** — Prepare submission bundle for MedGemma Impact Challenge
4. **Performance Benchmarking** — Systematic latency/throughput measurement
5. **Freeze for Submission** — Lock codebase and focus on documentation/presentation

## Locked Decisions

*None yet — awaiting user direction.*

## Dependencies from M13

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Real MedGemma inference | ✅ Integrated |
| Determinism | ✅ Verified |
| Competition HAI-DEF | ✅ Satisfied |
| CI integrity | ✅ Preserved |

---

## Notes

M13 successfully transitioned CLARITY from synthetic-only to empirical validation.

Given the competition deadline (February 24, 2026), M14 scope should be carefully chosen to maximize submission readiness without introducing risk.
