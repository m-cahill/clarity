**1. Competition Overview**
===========================

The **MedGemma Impact Challenge** is a skills‑based hackathon hosted on Kaggle and sponsored by **Google Research**.  
Participants build **human‑centered healthcare applications** using **MedGemma** and other models from Google’s **Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI‑DEF)**.

The competition emphasizes:

* Practical, real‑world healthcare impact
* Privacy‑preserving and edge‑deployable AI
* High‑quality writeups, reproducible code, and a concise demo video

* * *

**2. Deliverables & Minimum Requirements**
==========================================

A submission must include **all** of the following:

### **2.1 Required Components**

* **Writeup** (≤ 3 pages) using the provided template
* **Video demo** (≤ 3 minutes)
* **Reproducible code** demonstrating initial results
* **Single submission package** containing both video and writeup

### **2.2 Submission Format**

* Submitted as a **Kaggle Writeup** attached to the competition page
* Only **one** writeup per team (can be edited and resubmitted)
* The same writeup can be submitted to:
  * The **Main Track**, and
  * **One** special award track

* * *

**3. Evaluation Criteria**
==========================

Submissions are judged across five weighted categories:

| Criterion                           | Weight | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Effective use of HAI‑DEF models** | 20%    | Appropriate, high‑leverage use of MedGemma or other HAI‑DEF models. Use of at least one HAI‑DEF model is mandatory. |
| **Problem domain**                  | 15%    | Importance, clarity, unmet need, user definition, and improved user journey.                                        |
| **Impact potential**                | 15%    | Real or anticipated impact and how it was estimated.                                                                |
| **Product feasibility**             | 20%    | Technical clarity: fine‑tuning, performance analysis, application stack, deployment challenges, practical usage.    |
| **Execution & communication**       | 30%    | Quality of video, writeup, code organization, clarity, and narrative cohesion.                                      |
