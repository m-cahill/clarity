## Flexible Milestone Map (Paste into `clarity.md`)

> **Milestone numbering is intentionally flexible.** Each milestone is “one capability,” end-to-end verified, and produces audit-defensible artifacts.

### Deploy/CI Notes for `clarity.md`

* **Netlify**: use Deploy Previews for PR visibility when frontend exists. ([Netlify Docs][2])
* **Render**: use Deploy Hooks (or a deploy action) for backend deploy triggers. ([Render][3])
* **Workflow security**: prefer pinning actions to SHAs (document exceptions). ([GitHub Docs][1])
